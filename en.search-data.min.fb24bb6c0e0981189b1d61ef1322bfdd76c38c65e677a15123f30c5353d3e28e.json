Looks like you are here for contributing to the wiki\u0026hellip;Let me help you with a few pointers!\n The aim of this open-source project to create a central repository for all the cybersecurity content, which can be consumed by security researchers and newbies in the field. You can add content related to any field and this is also a great place to showcase the content you have created. The scope of the project is whatever you think can help out folks get started in the cyber security. We have hosted everything on to Github, click on the button and it will take you to Github Contribute    Structure #  The structure is required for uniformity, so here are a few template, to help you curate the content.\nThe _index.md file acts as the index for that specific directory.  To add a new category A category is the high level overview. For example - \u0026ldquo;Application Security\u0026rdquo; is a category.\nSteps - Create a new directory in docs directory. Add a new file inside the newly created directory called _index.md with the following content in it.\n--- title: \u0026lt;!-- Category Name Here. --\u0026gt; bookCollapseSection: true --- \u0026lt;!-- Your content here. --\u0026gt; a new category will be created.\nEach Category will contain an images/ folder.\nDirectory Structure -\ncontent/ ├─ docs/ │ ├─ category-name/ │ │ ├─ images/ │ │ ├─ _index.md    Create a New Sub Category To create a sub category in side a category, we need to create a directory inside the main category, which will contain all the different markdown files of different content.\n--- title: \u0026lt;!-- SubCategory Name Here. --\u0026gt; bookCollapseSection: true --- \u0026lt;!-- Your content here. --\u0026gt;    To add a new page Each page will contain the following content -\n--- title: \u0026lt;!-- Title of the page here. --\u0026gt; --- \u0026lt;!-- Your content here. --\u0026gt; Images can be used in each page by using the complete link - content/docs/\u0026lt;category-name\u0026gt;/images/\u0026lt;image-name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;extension\u0026gt; Example -\n![Alt text](content/docs/cloud-security/images/image.png)    Infrastructure #  The wiki is built on the Hugo. If you can help with any improvements, feature additions, etc. You can create an Issueand we can discuss it over there.\nAdditional Features #  Linking an Internal Document {{\u0026lt; relref \u0026#34;\u0026lt;!-- document/path/here --\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} It will help hugo internally process the document easily.\n  Other cool elements to be added can be found in the shortcode section.\nTest Locally #    Clone the repository to make changes locally -\ngit clone git@github.com:payatu/cybersec-wiki.git git submodule init git submodule update   Install Hugo Extended Latest Version.\n  From the parent location of repository where the source code is, run\nhugo server It will start a local server to test the changes that you have made, in terms of look, feel and content.\n  Once satisfied with the changes made, push the changes to GitHub.\n  Create a Pull Request and if everything looks fine, we will be merging the content to the Cyber Security Wiki.\n  "}]
