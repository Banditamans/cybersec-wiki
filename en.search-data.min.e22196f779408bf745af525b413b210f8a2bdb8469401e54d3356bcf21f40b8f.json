Looks like you are here for contributing to the wiki\u0026hellip;Let me help you with a few pointers!\n The aim of this open-source project to create a central repository for all the cybersecurity content, which can be consumed by security researchers and newbies in the field. You can add content related to any field and this is also a great place to showcase the content you have created. The scope of the project is whatever you think can help out folks get started in the cyber security. We have hosted everything on to Github, click on the button and it will take you to Github Contribute    Structure #  The structure is required for uniformity, so here are a few template, to help you curate the content.\nTo add a new category A category is the high level overview. For example - \u0026ldquo;Application Security\u0026rdquo; is a category.\nSteps - Create a new directory in docs directory. Add a new file inside the newly created directory called _index.md with the following content in it.\n--- bookFlatSection: true bookCollapseSection: true --- \u0026lt;!-- Your content here. --\u0026gt; a new category will be created.\nRepeat the same step to create sub categories as well.\nEach Category will contain an images/ folder.\nThe directory structure will look something like this (example for cloud security) -\ndocs/ ├─ cloud-security/ │ ├─ aws/ │ │ ├─ labs.md │ │ ├─ reports.md │ ├─ images/ │ ├─ _index.md    To add a new page Each page will contain the following content -\n--- title: \u0026lt;!-- Title of the page here. --\u0026gt; --- \u0026lt;!-- Your content here. --\u0026gt; Images can be used in each page by using the complete link - content/docs/cloud-security/images/image.png Example -\n![Alt text](content/docs/cloud-security/images/image.png)    Infrastructure #  The wiki is built on the Hugo. If you can help with any improvements, feature additions, etc. Hit us up at wiki@payatu.io or create an Issue and we can discuss it over there.\nCool Features #  Linking an external URL {{\u0026lt; external title=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} It will add a external link symbol after the link for the UX and will open up the link in a new tab.\n  Linking an internal document {{\u0026lt; ref \u0026#34;\u0026lt;!-- document/path/here --\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} It will help hugo internally process the document easily.\n  Other cool elements to be added can be found in the shortcode section.\n"}]
